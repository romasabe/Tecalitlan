                Tecalitlan all started with Jose Carlos Garcia Sr. He grew up in El Josefino, a pueblito (small town) in Jalisco, Mexico.
                He left his home for Mexico City at a young age to pursue a better life. He learned how to make tacos there, but eventually his time there was cut short. 
                He instead decided to move to Chicago with his uncle and brother. At the age of 21, Jose and his brother started
                Tecalitlan at 1814 W Chicago Ave. The location was home to tecaltilan for over 47 years. There, his son, Jose Carlos Garcia Jr., and his
                daughter, Karla Garcia began to work at the restaraunt at a very young age. Karla remembers doing books and accounting for the restaurant
                in College. When their father retired, he entrusted the restaurant to them. Carlos being the head chef, and Karla being the one keeping the 
                restaraunt together. In 2005, Teca introduced Los 3 Garcias Tequila to the restaurant, owned by the Garcia familly. Tecalitlan was always a 
                place where community could gather, people from all over West Town would flock to Teca to have a drink and eat food that reminded them 
                of home.

            <p class="tecastory">
                The old Tecalitlan building was sold to new owners in 2008 due to the housing crisis, Tecalitlan was stil able to keep its doors
                open. The pandemic hit and Teca had to shut down in person service. Online orders were still possible
                through a ghost kitchen; however, it was never the same. Finally in 2022, their lease expired and the building changed owners once again. 
                After much searching, the siblings were able to find a location in NewCity, where Tecalitlan is located today. Tecalitlan is still the same
                even after moving locations, there's the same faces, same food, and the same sense of community and hospitallity that they've always had. Stop by their New
                location for amazing food and margaritas that have 47 years of history behind them and new Sabores de Mexico events, special tastings filled with 4 course meals 
                that share the rich cullinary culture of Mexico.
